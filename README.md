# CppSTL

The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of classes that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures.
These features help you create more efficient, performant, and reusable code.
Programmer Eduardo Corpe√±o reviews the most popular elements of the C++ STL, so you can use these tools in your projects as soon as you finish the training.
Learn how to use sequence containers such as vectors, lists, stacks, and queues for data storage, and use associative containers like sets and maps to implement associative arrays.
Eduardo explains which elements perform best in which scenarios, and shows how to program with STL for maximum efficiency.
A series of challenges at the end of each chapter allow you to test your knowledge along the way.
The repository contains exercises from Linkedin Learning.
